# Data Visualization Final Project: WPI Foot Traffic
## By: JP Bulman, Michael Clements, and DJ Alvarado

## About
For our final project, we surveyed ~60 students from WPI asking them where they are each hour from 8am to
8pm on Mondays. Above are several visualizations of the data we were able to get. First is an animated
map that shows people as small dots traveling through campus. Second is a heatmap of the number of
people in a given place at a given time. Next is an interactive bar graph where you can select a time
and it will show you the number of people in every building on campus. Finally, there is a series of
miniature bar graphs, one for each building, that shows the population of the building throughout the
day.

## Things to Know
If an individual marked themselves as 'Off campus or at home' for a certain time, their dot is
moved to the West Street lot. If someone marked 'Other or not listed', their dot flies to (0, 0). In
addition, there are some biases to consider. The biggest bias we had stemmed from our sampling
technique. Since we distributed this to our friends and classmates, our sample deviated slightly from an
ideal campus population sample. This can be see around 1-3pm where lots of people go to Fuller
Laboratories - this is just when our data visualization class is held. This is the people from our class who filled out the survey bleeding through.
