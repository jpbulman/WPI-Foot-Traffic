## Technical Achievements
Our team's biggest technical achievement was creating our own dataset by crowdsourcing. Since there was no existing data for this, we had to make a [survey](https://forms.gle/2gkh3p8pCLXhL8LN9) and send it out to WPI students. We were able to get 59 responses, which gave us a lot of diversity in terms of location. The final results of this survey can be found in ```responses.csv```.
